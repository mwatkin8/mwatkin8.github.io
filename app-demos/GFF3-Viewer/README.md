## Interactive GFF3 Viewer

This viewer is designed to provide a user with a high-level overview of their GFF3 file. The specification for valid GFF3 files is hosted by the Sequence Ontology here: https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md

Our code is broken up by view into separate js files found in the js directory. 

The "clusterize" library was used in our feature list to enable faster scrolling for the large amount of features. A clusterize js file can be found in the js directory, a clusterize css file can be found in the css directory, and the master file can be found in the root directory. Clusterize documentation can be found here: https://clusterize.js.org/

Our test data can be found in the data directory in the "GFF3_Files" directory. 

Here is the link to the project website: https://acmiller015.github.io/Interactive-GFF3-Viewer/. The project website contains a link to a 2-min screen-cast which provides a brief overview of the Interactive GFF3 Viewer.


Enjoy!
