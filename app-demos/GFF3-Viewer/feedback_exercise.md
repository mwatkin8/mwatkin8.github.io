## Peer giving feedback - James Brisette (his group member wasn’t there)

James was really helpful. Even though our project is very specific to genomics, and he didn’t have much background in it, he gave us some very practical suggestions on how to improve. It was almost better that he didn’t have a lot of background because he was able to give us high-level fundamental issues to think about.

There were two main critics which he gave us. 

* The first was a concern that although this may be a step up from command line manipulation and exploration of the file, we should still provide an easily accessible way for people to opt to use commands and searching methods that they are familiar with. He asked us if there was some way to mock the way that people currently search these kinds of files on the command line. I thought it was a very helpful critic because we were so anxious to improve the processes that we didn’t give much thought to what people are already used to. In response to his critic, we think that the filtering options available may not be clear enough. We will test a basic implementation on a user who is very familiar with searching these files and use her feedback to determine whether or not we are addressing the concern that James surfaced for us.

* Another critic was that James thought there should be some way to compare features side-by-side. This was in response to our showing him our feature detail window which only shows one feature at a time. At his suggestion we are going to try to implement an option to add feature windows on screen. This will enable users to pull up two features (such as genes) and be able to visually compare amounts of parents and children, the different scores, etc. This was really helpful feedback and it was really critical that we got it so early on so that we can adjust our design before we begin coding.
